<hr />

<h3>Sci-Fi</h3>
<h4>1. Star Wars (1977)</h4>
<p>
  Star Wars gave us a whole new cinematic galaxy that feels so much larger,
  deeper, and richer than anything seen before. Star Wars tells the story of
  Luke training under Master Yoda, Han and Leia heading to Cloud City, and Darth
  Vader dropping the daddy of all twists. In it's time, these movies displayed
  astonishing model work, dizzying dogfights, rich planetary sets, and ferocious
  lightsaber duels. It is, simply, bigger and better than anything seen prior,
  and was influential t sci-fi films that would come after. As far as sci-fi
  goes, it's not the cinema of ideas - but it blockbuster spectacle is
  near-unmatched.

<h4>2. The Matrix (1999)</h4>
<p>
  At the dawn of the Internet age, the Wachowskis gave Hollywood science fiction
  a major upgrade. Drawing from cyberpunk anime, philosophy, and religion, the
  sisters cooked up an era-defining tale that spoke to generational malaise, the
  rise of technology, and a pre-millennial society ready to break out of its
  long-held programming. Keanu Reeves is hacker Neo, who comes to learn that the
  world isn't real - he and the rest of humanity are living in a computer
  simulation called the Matrix, while being harvested as fuel for sentient
  machines. But in learning about this unreality, he also comes to know how to
  break it - bending the laws of physics, seeing through the code, and uploading
  kung-fu moves directly into his brain. It's one of the coolest films ever
  made, deeply stylish and incredibly visionary (particularly the invention of
  bullet-time and the static camera rig that made it possible). Plus, it has a
  whole new layer of meaning in its reassessment as a piece of blockbuster queer
  cinema, a story exploring the idea that internal and external realities may be
  different, coming from a pair of Trans creators. In a word: woah.
</p>

<h4>3. Blade Runner (1982)</h4>
<p>
  What sci-fi film can best Ridley Scott's genre classic Alien? His other genre
  classic, the unbeatable Blade Runner - an initially misunderstood masterpiece
  that, over multiple decades and several recuts, stands as the pinnacle of
  cinematic science fiction. Based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream Of
  Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner conjures a bleak vision of a then-future 2019
  Los Angeles - an imperious flame-belching hellscape in which Harrison Ford's
  'blade runner' cop Rick Deckard is tasked with tracking down a group of
  human-engineered Replicants who have escaped back to Earth from a working
  colony. As he 'retires' them one by one, he comes to question his own
  humanity, both literal and metaphorical. With its ruminations on what it means
  to be human, Blade Runner is ideas-driven sci-fi all the way. But it's a
  visual feast too, its interpretation of a futuristic urban landscape - with
  giant video screens, glowing neon lights and bustling city streets - still
  jaw-dropping to behold. Coupled with a haunting Vangelis synth score, and
  Rutger Hauer's arresting turn as Replicant leader Roy Batty (whose "time to
  die" speech is a total spine-tingler), it's nigh-on untouchable.

<h4>1. Captain Ron (1992)</h4>
<p>
  A Chicagoan inherits an old yacht. He, his wife, daughter and son fly to a
  Caribbean island and hire a dubious Captain Ron to sail them on an adventure
  to Miami.
</p>
<h4>2. Overboard (1987)</h4>
<p>
  A cruel but beautiful heiress mocks and cheats a hired carpenter. When she
  gets amnesia after an accident, he decides to introduce her to regular life by
  convincing her that they're husband and wife.
</p>
<h4>3. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987)</h4>
<p>

  Thanksgiving, with a lovable oaf of a shower-curtain-ring salesman as his only
  companion.
